# Introduction

## About me
I've been working on Android since 2009, and before that had been quite fluent in Java programming. At some point I had read about the Android NDK, but I never gave it much thoughts.

In 2013, I joined Deezer team and started working on Deezer's SDK for Android. That is when I started using the Android NDK intenslively.

At first, all I did was maintain the existing code base. Most of it was in Java, and I only touched the C code a couple of times.

In 2014, I had to rewrite a big part of the native code. I was a complete newbie, most of my knowledge in C/C++ was memories from my college years, and I was the only one in the Android team working with the NDK.

So I took a deep breath, opened StackOverflow (among others) and experienced my first dive in the NDK world. I realized many things could be done with it and decided to go deeper and deeper to get a better understanding of what could be done.

This is how this book came to life. I've always had this passion for sharing my discoveries with people, be it through blogs, twitter, conferences or courses. This time, I wanted to try a different medium, and decided to go for a book.
