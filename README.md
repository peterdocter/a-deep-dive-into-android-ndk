# Introduction

I've been working on Android since 2009, and before that had been quite fluent in Java programming.

At some point I had read about the Android NDK, but I never gave it much thoughts.

In 2013, I joined Deezer team and started working on Deezer's SDK for Android. That is when I started using the Android NDK.

At first, all I did was maintain the existing code base. Most of it was in Java, and I only touched the C code a couple of times.

In 2014, I had to rewrite a big part of the native code, which is when I took my first dive in Android NDK. I realized many things could be done with it and decided to go deeper and deeper to get a better understanding of what could be done.
